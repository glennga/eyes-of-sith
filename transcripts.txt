Welcome to Eyes of Sith!

You are a Sith Lord who has been tasked with killing another Sith in
the temple, Darth Nox, by your master Darth Imperius. This is your hardest
task to date- but also the most rewarding. Finish this, and you will finally
be promoted to Darth. Be warned, facing Nox in your current state is... unwise
Collect the right items to defeat the Dark Lord, or perish trying.

The only commands allowed in this game are: 
(LOOK WALK INV HELP QUIT RELOAD SELECT TALK A B C)

To interact with an NPC, first 'select' them and enter 'talk'. NPCs must be
referred to without spaces in their names (e.g. Darth Nox = darth-nox).

Enjoy the game!

the floor and watch as the rest of the temple passes on by.
